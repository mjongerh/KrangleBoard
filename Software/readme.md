# Software
As one might expect, I made the software with [QMK](https://qmk.fm).
To edit and compile the software, one can copy the Krangle [folder](./Krangle) and put it in the [keyboards](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards) folder.
Additional and very extensive instruction can be found in the original [documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware).

The software provided here is made for a teensy2.0++.
It uses an unoptimized PIN layout as follows:

This can also be viewed in the GUI of [kbfirmware](https://kbfirmware.com) by uploading the [JSON file](krangle_kbfirmware.json).
